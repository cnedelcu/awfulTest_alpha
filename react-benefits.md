React JS – The Need & Key Benefits
ReactJS – the JavaScript library, is an open-source framework, supported by Facebook and a huge community of developers, originally released in 2013. Majorly leveraged to build rich user interfaces of web and mobile applications, ReactJS works on the concept of MVC.

It needs just a basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript, that is the prime reason it has gained so much popularity as a front-end web development tool.

Undoubtedly, when the popularity charts for ReactJS are soaring high, there ought to be certain key reasons why developers love this framework to such an extent. Though the list is quite a big one, here are the most significant features and benefits that it offers, that makes it a desirable technology by one and all:

Faster Go-To-Market Time
Organizations are keen to adapt to technologies that assist them in fastening their time to go to market, complete their software solutions on time and implement them without any hassle. ReactJS is just perfect for this since it has a high development speed because of its multiple reusable components.

Developers find it easy and manageable to build applications at a great speed. It ensures high-end productivity and accelerates maintenance. React also has React Native, a cross-platform mobile app development tool that works wonders.

A Secure Future
With technologies coming and going so haphazardly, the need for a stable technology is what organizations are looking for. And, ReactJS is just that, since it is backed by big names like Facebook, Instagram and millions of developers globally.

Even, with peer competition increasing, ReactJS has been able to sustain its popularity level and in fact, has been soaring high still. Hence, developers find security and stability in opting for React.

Ease Of Use
With so many tools and frameworks doing the rounds, what developers get attracted to is the simplicity with which the tool operates.

ReactJS has turned to be an easy option for novices and experts, alike. It has not only streamlined the job of programming but has also simplified resource administration to a great level.

Quick Rendering With V-DOM
The Facebook team has given Virtual Document Object Model (V-DOM) to ReactJS because of which it offers a high-speed rendering, less time wastage, enhanced user experience and better app performance. This is mainly for highly complex and dynamic applications.

Efficient Design And Developer Tools
React comes loaded with a great set of effective design, developer and debugging toolset. React developer tools are there for certain browsers like Chrome and Firefox. These empower developers to undergo inspection in the V-DOM. Even tracking of the hierarchy of components is possible.

Clear Abstraction
As one of its key advantages, ReactJS offers a good level of abstraction that signifies that none of the complicated internal processes is exposed to the users.

Much so, because it is not needed too. Internal processes better stay away from the end-users to lessen the confusion and that is possible by using ReactJS.

The development team, who is using ReactJS, needs to have a proper understanding of the complete life cycle of the components and need not always follow any pattern base like MVC.
